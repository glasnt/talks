# talks

This repo contains all of my talks. 

For a webview, go to [glasnt.com/talks](http://glasnt.com/talks)

## technical overview

Most of these talks use [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/), while some earlier versions use a system called [projection](https://github.com/afcowie/projection). 

Both are web-based presentation formats, which can be run by invoking a local web server on your system and navigating to the URL. 

For example, using Python 3: 
   
    cd [../]talks/
    python3 -m http.server 1337
    open http://localhost:1337

Speaker notes can be viewed by pressing `[s]`. I use the notes mostly for reminders, and should not be assumed to be of any use to anyone wanting a general review of the talk. 

## talk writeups

If you want to get a TLDR on any of my talks, if there is an associated write-up, it'll be linked on the main [talks](http://glasnt.com/talks) page.
