Note: 
Hi! I'm katie, and this isn't the talk you're expecting. 

---

##= .thin[What this talk isn't.]

Note: 
this isn't a talk about "the way" to deploy your app

This isn't a state of the union, a dive into any particualr 
part of the process. 

This talk is more describing the complexities around the process, and, inessense. 
TODO: Ensure this is accurate
---


#= .thin[What .b[is] deployment,<br>anyway?]

Note: 
We'll discuss, well ,what is deployment, anyway? 

---
#= .thin[What is .prokyon[django] deployment,<br>anyway?]
Note: and specifically within the context of deploying a django application. 

But I'm choosing django here for a reason, which will become apparaent later. 
---
#= Points of interest
## out of the box .prokyon[django]
## complexities
## helpers

Note: we'll be taking a journey today, so instead of an agenda, here are at least a few points of interest along our trip. 
TODO: ensure this is accurate

---
#= .prokyon[django] 2.2.5
# .flux[python] 3.7.4

Note: the versions I'm targetting today are specifically django 2.2.5 and python 3.7.4

If you're joining me on YouTube from the year 2027, I'm sorry, things have changed since, but hopefully you find value in this talk!

---
##= no extra addons

Note: we're also just going to stick to base django

No addons, no cookiecutter templates. This talk should be useful if you're anywhere from looking at django

to having your djangogirls tutorial project working on your laptop

to a more complex setup, but no extra complexities. 

TODO: is "addons" the best word here?

---

##= Let's look at .prokyon[django] 

Note: so let's get started, by taking a look at django as it comes out of the box

# .quote["We're in the business of<br>making Web frameworks,<br>not Web servers"]
### - .prokyon[django] documentation
Note: I want to pull this out and elaborate. 

Django is an extremely stable, production ready, web framework.

Django is very good at being a web framework. 

The fact that it provides any local web server functionality at all is amazing, but the fact that it calls out that it's not for production is also very very good. 

There are other webservers you can use in production. We'll get to that. TODO ENSURE WE GET TO THIS.

but all the helpers we used in development cannot and should not be used

## complex in production

Note: which makes our production use.. complex. 
---
##= byo web server
## byo static server
## byo database

Note: django doesn't provide you wiht a webserver or database that's production ready, so you have yo use your own, but store bought is fine. We'll get to the store later.  
---
<br><BR><BR>
# .poly[Flask]
## simpler in production<br>.h3[(comparatively)]
Note: 
Compare the out of the box functionality of django to something like flask

A lot of tutorials you see out there use flask as the target of a  python web server deployment demonstration

This is because of one simple fact
---
#= .b[state]

Note: django is a stateful application. It has a database out of the box and static assets. 

Flask by default does not. It can, but out of the box, it doesn't 

---

#= stateful applications
## complex in production

Note: any application that has state is complex in production. 

This is why I chose to use django for my context

If I'd chosen flask, the discussion of deployment could be **really easy**

buyt it's not just django; any time you care about persistence you add complexity to your deployments. 

And, funnily enough, this is also mentioned in the docs

---
@= deployment_00.png

vv [➚](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/howto/static-files/deployment/#serving-static-files-in-production)

Note: every production setup will be a bit different.

#= .quote["Every production setup<br>will be a bit different"]
### - .prokyon[django] documentation
Note:
I'm not sure who added this line to the documentation

which has been in the docs for a decade at this point

but whoever it was was such a smart cookie. 

This is so so important.

So important it's on it's own slide. 

But this statement is so so true. 

---


#= .quote["It depends."]
### - every deployment talk ever 

Note: 

Nearly every talk I've seen on deployment includes a line likee

it depends

When trying to tell you the "one true way" to do django deployments. 

Because it's true. 

But I'm not going to use that line. I'm going to use another one. 

---

#= .quote["I'm an operations engineer. I'm not your operations engineer."]
### - @glasnt

Note: I prefer this line. 

I'm an operations engineer, I'm not your operations engineer. 

I've been a sysadmin, operations engineer, SRE, whatever you want to call it

on and off for nearly the last decade. 

I've worked for 

... web hosting providers

... platforms as a service

and now

infrastructure as a service. 

And each and every deployment is different and unqiue and beautiful and complex.

--- 
<br><br>
# to deploy a stateful app 
Note: and for any stateful application, you have at the bare minimum three major segments
---
<br><br>
# to deploy a stateful app:
## run web framework
Note: you need a way to run the web framework, whatever it is

---
<br><br>
# to deploy a stateful app:
## run web framework<br>connect to a database
Note: a way to connect to your database
---
<br><br>
# to deploy a stateful app:
## run web framework<br>connect to a database<br>serve static files
Note: and a way to serve whatever static apps you have. 

this exact trifecta is the same for Django. 
---
<br><br>
# to deploy .prokyon[django]: 
## run django<br>connect to a database<br>serve static files
Note: you need to run the web  framework, connect to a database, and serve the static. 

These are the same requirements are for any stateful application

Therefore, we can explore what a stateful application deployment means without
having to keep outselves within django itself

But, thankfully for us using django, we have some helpers. 

---
<br><BR>
# .prokyon[django] helpers
## WSGI<br>.c[migrate]<br>.c[collectstatic]

Note: in order they are wsgi compatitbility, the migrate command, and the collect static command. 

The rest (TODO) of this talk will be describing how these helpers work. 

Which will help us in exploring the options we have for deployment 
---
#= WSGI
## Web Server Gateway Interface

Note: the web server gateway interface is a python standard for web servers

i love the docs

django's proimary deployment platform

is wsgi 

! as of django 2.2!!

Note: but I have a better question

---
<br><BR>
## How much<br>custom infrastructure<br>do you want?
Note: how much custom infrastrcutre do you want? 

Because as we saw before, every production setup is a bit different

but there are plenty of options out there for you if you want to use a template that works for 
80% of cases

and if you only have a standard django app, then these are going to work for you. 
---

<br><BR>
## .so[How much<br>custom infrastructure<br>do you want?]
Note: and probably more importantly. 
--- 
<br><BR>
## How much<br>infrastructure management<br>do you want<br>to do yourself?

Note: how much infrastrcutre management do you want to do yourself?

If you are a django developer, then you probably want to develop django

you don't want to be spending your time trying to manage your infrastrcture

it's super interesting, sure, but when you want is just to get your application online, then why not pay someone who has spent the time to setup a way that works for 80% of websites 

In our setup, we don't have anything custom, so why not let someone else manage tings for you?

put in more simpler terms

---
<br><BR>
## What<br>do you want<br>to worry about?


Note:  what do you want to worry about
---

#= Managed hosting:
## Platform as a Service
## Infrastructure as a Service
vv * non-exhaustive

Note: in the managed hosting world, for the complexity of project we're talking about, there are two major options

PaaS and IaaS
---

#= Managed hosting:
## PaaS
## IaaS
vv * non-exhaustive

Note: you'll often seen these abbreviated as Paas or IaaS, because words are getting long and we're busy technologists. 

And yes, this is non-exhaustive. Within the scope of deploying a django application, these are the two major options. 

You could go as detailed as running your app on a server you have in your own home or business ("on-prem"), or trying to squeeze django into a function as a service, but these are the 20% of cases. 

I'm going to focus on the ones that are much more suited for django

---
<BR><BR>
# Platform as a Service
### worry about:<br>your .prokyon[django] app, data 

vv Example providers: Heroku, Divio, PythonAnywhere

Note: in general your platforms as service are going to be places where you provide your code to them, often fit to some sort of template, which normally includes the command to run to get your app working. This will often be uwsgi or guniconr

# Platform as a Service
### managed for you: <br>web server, operating system,<br>hardware, storage, networking...
vv Example providers: Heroku, Divio, PythonAnywhere

Note: the things that will be managed for you include the web server (often included in whatever template you have), the operating system, the physical hardware, the storage, networking, and a whole host of other things. 

On the otherhand, if you have opinions about some of the earlier elements in this, you can jump down into

# Infrastructure as a Service
### worry about:<br>your .prokyon[django] app, data<br>web server, operating system
vv Example providers: Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Azure
Note: IaaS. Where you can worry about your web server and operating system.

# Infrastructure as a Service
### managed for you: <br>hardware, storage, networking...
vv Example providers: Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Azure
Note: and you pay for someone else to manage the hardware, storage, etc. 

Now this is very very much an overgeneralisation, as there is an entire other talk on the complexities of infrastrcutre as a service. 

but there is a reason I mentioned this

And the next one is a database. 
and here's the secret

##= Managed databases<br>are just a specialised<br>aaS

Note: managed databases are just specalised "as a service"

whatever bucket you want to put them in depends on your definition, if they IaaS or Paas or even Software as a service, but either way, they're a service.

## Managed database
### worry about:<br> your data models
vv Example providers: your PaaS or IaaS provider
Note: you define your data models in your app

## Managed database
### managed for you:<br>storage, backups, persistence, maintenance...
 
vv Example providers: your PaaS or IaaS provider

Note: your database host will often handle everyhitng from backups to storage (including scaling storage, which is often very good. 

These will often be available from your web server provider, which is often a very good idea because the closer your web server and database the faster you can send data between the two parts of your application.

migrate command

applying migrate to your database

static

just about platform as a service

collectstatic

applying colectstatic to your app

---

actually deploying

running these commands
but also copying your code to your server

### continuous deployment, monitoring, scaling, logging,<br>high availablilty, load balancing, kubernetes,<br>multi-region, zero downtime deployments,<br>blue/green deployments, A/B testing, containers,<br>configuration management, automation... 

Note: there's so much more to this topic that I just can't even hope to cover. 

Nearly each of these topics is their own entire *conference* worth of material. 

But hopefuully I've been able to help you just see a bit behind the curtain of deployment.
