Note: I have over a decade of software development and systems administration behind me. 

Before getting into the Python/Django space, I was a ruby dev, working with Rails and Sinatra stacks 

But before that, around the time the magic was being removed from Django, I was in my first tech job, and using my first tech stack:

Note: I haven't used APEX for years. But, there's one thing that I have an intrinstic knowledge of

Note: SQL

It's like riding a bike. Left outer joins are always going to be a bit.. fuzzy, but I can't count the amount of times I wished there was an option of throwing a LIKE clause on search results. 


---
@= djadmin.png
Note: Getting back to Django. 

I'm still getting my head around how Django works

I mean, sure, for a sufficiently setup existing django application, the admin makes things so intuitive. 

But if you were to try and tell me how things work underneath

##= > *"Oh, just use the shell!"*
Note: Even worse when I'm told "Oh, just use the shell"

It's an empty space. But I've been told that this is where the actual Django magic lives

Note: The ORM

The Object relational mapper

The engine that makes django go

But without context, what does that even mean?
---
#= Context

Note: Context is important. 

So for the purposes of this, let's break away from the normal. 

A number of tutorials start with a clean slate, and assume you have little to know dev experience. DjangoGirls is great for complete beginners to development

But it's not so helpful for developers who come into the space with prior knowledge

It's also not helpful for the way that I came into Django; trying to fix an existing project

So for the purposes of this, we're going to use an existing project
---
~@ hunterbird.jpg

Note: 

We're going to be a noisy myna, and go bughunting. 

We're going to find outselves an existing project, in this case, a field of kale, and hunt about trying to find some delicious bugs. 

The field may look daunting, endless complexities that seem impossible to understand, but we'll get there. 

---
#= Context

Note: so, our context today isn't going to be the standard blog site or news portal. 

It's going to be about something near and dear to my heart
---
#= ✨
Note: emoji
---
@^ unicodex_index.png

Note: 

If you've seen my {DjangoCon EU 2016 talk,emoji talks before}

this website would be sort of familiar to you. 

I call it.. Unicodex. It's a django-backed database of different emoji from different platforms 

On the home page there's a bunch of emoji and if you click on one

---

@^ unicodex_sparkles_bug.png

Note: it shows you the emoji from different vendors and the versions. 

So given this website exists, we can start poking around in the shell
---
##= "Just use the shell"
Note: what they mean here is the django shell
---
$$terminal bash
$$prompt ~
cd project<br>
$$prompt ~/project
$$w ./manage.py shell

Note: which is available using the manage.py shell command
---
$$terminal python3.6
$$prompt ~
cd project<br>
$$prompt ~/project
./manage.py shell<br>
Python 3.6.3 (default, Nov  9 2017, 15:58:30)<br>

Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.<br>
(InteractiveConsole)<br>
$$w &gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;  

Note:

Here, we're presented with an interactive console

All shell is is a python environment where the django environment path has been loaded. 

From here you can interact with your django projet directly.

---
##= "But, how do I use the shell?"
##- *"..."*

Note: but how do I use the shell

First things first. For an SQL dev, the first thing they normally do in a foreign system is
---
##= Finding all tables
---
<pre><code><c>&dash;&dash; MySQL</c>
show tables

<c>&dash;&dash; PostgreSQL</c>
\dt

<c>&dash;&dash; Oracle</c>
<r>SELECT * <br>&nbsp; FROM</r> dba.tables;
</code></pre>

Note: depending on which flavour of database is most familiar to you, you'd try and issue one of these commands

For mysql, for postgres, for oracle

But we're not in a database console, we're in the django shell. We need to use ORM codes. 

 
---
<pre><code><c>&num; ORM</c>
<c>&num; ...</c>

Note: SO! To list all the tables in a project in the django shell!...

there's no real good way. 

In order to start querying model objects, you need to import the models

In django, a project has multiple applications, or apps, and an app can have one or many models. 

The model code is the powerhouse of django. the ORM manipulates models. A lot of the logic for a django project is going to be in the model.py of it's various applications. 
But without looking at the model code, and understanding what you're looking at in order to generate the import statement, you can be at a complete loss. 

Thankfully, django is clever and has helpful methods you can call to generate a list of imports for all the models in the project
---
<pre><code><c># Generate import statements</c>
<r>from</r> django.apps <r>import</r> apps
&nbsp;
<r>for</r> app_config <r>in</r> apps.get_app_configs():
&nbsp; l <r>=</r> app_config.name
&nbsp; <r>for</r> model <r>in</r> app_config.get_models():
&nbsp; &nbsp; n <r>=</r> model._meta.object_name
&nbsp; &nbsp; <l>print</l>(<d>f'from</d> <l>{</l>l<l>}</l><d>.models import </d><l>{</l>n<l>}</l>')
</code></pre>

Note: here's some I prepared earlier

We're going to import the django apps

And iterate over all the apps that django knows about

For each of those, we're going to get all the models

and print an import statement for each

Note: and what we get back is some generated import statements about 

This output will have similarities across django projects

the first few in this list are pretty standard fair; authentication, sessions, sites, admin

There's also one in there called aldryn_sso. this is because I've hosted this on divio cloud. We're holding a workshop during the sprints on it, come see me afterwards! 

But what we're looking for is, in a lovely happenstance, the models that match the name of the website we saw earlier -- unicodex.

<br><br>
</code></pre>

Note: the SQL would be familiar

Adding a where clause for, say, sparkles
---
<pre><code>
<c>&dash;&dash; SQL</c>
<r>SELECT * <br>&nbsp; FROM</r> unicodex_codepoint c<br>&nbsp;<r>WHERE</r> <l>c</l>.<l>name</l> <r>&equals;</r> <d>'Sparkles'</d>; 

<c>&num; ORM</c>
Codepoint.objects.filter(<o>name&equals;</o>'Sparkles')
</code></pre>

Note: this maps to the ORM as filter. where the name column is a keyword argument of filter. 


---
$$terminal python3.6
$$py from unicodex.models import Codepoint
$$pyw Codepoint.objects.filter(name='Sparkles')

Note: so in our fresh terminal, we import Codepoint

Then run our filter
---
$$terminal python3.6
$$py from unicodex.models import Codepoint
$$py Codepoint.objects.filter(name='Sparkles')
&lt;QuerySet [&lt;Codepoint: Sparkles>]><br>
$$pyw
Note: and we get back a queryset with a single object: sparkles
---
##= Get specific record

Note: we can also just return one specific record, instead of a queryset
---
$$terminal python3.6
$$py from unicodex.models import Codepoint
$$py Codepoint.objects.filter(name='Sparkles')
&lt;QuerySet [&lt;Codepoint: Sparkles>]><br>
$$pyw Codepoint.objects.get(name='Sparkles')
Note: so where last time we used filter

This time we use get
---
$$terminal python3.6
$$py from unicodex.models import Codepoint
$$py Codepoint.objects.filter(name='Sparkles')
&lt;QuerySet [&lt;Codepoint: Sparkles>]><br>
$$py Codepoint.objects.get(name='Sparkles')
&lt;Codepoint: Sparkles><br>
$$pyw

Note: and we get a single object
---
$$terminal python3.6
$$py from unicodex.models import Codepoint
$$py Codepoint.objects.filter(name='Sparkles')
&lt;QuerySet [&lt;Codepoint: Sparkles>]><br>
$$py Codepoint.objects.get(name='Sparkles')
&lt;Codepoint: Sparkles><br>
$$pyw Codepoint.objects.get()

Note: a thing to note about get 

Get will always return one and only one object

THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE

So if you try and run get, say, without any limiatations
---
$$terminal python3.6
$$py from unicodex.models import Codepoint
$$py Codepoint.objects.filter(name='Sparkles')
&lt;QuerySet [&lt;Codepoint: Sparkles>]><br>
$$py Codepoint.objects.get(name='Sparkles')
&lt;Codepoint: Sparkles><br>
$$py Codepoint.objects.get()
Traceback (most recent call last):<br>

$$pyw

Note: we get a MultipleObjectsReturned error

which tells us that it would have returned three Codepoint objects, which is just far too much for get to handle. 
---
##= Joins

Note: So now we come to the fun bit. Joins

Anyone who's worked with SQL for long enough will know the venn diagrams for inner joins, outer joins, left joins, right joins, and it can get a bit confusing

Thankfully, especially for someone like me who has forgotten so much SQL, the ORM makes joins a joy. 
---
<pre><code><c>&dash;&dash; SQL</c><br><r>SELECT</r> d.<r>*</r> <br>&nbsp; <r>FROM</r> unicodex_codepoint c,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;unicodex_design d<br>&nbsp;<r>WHERE</r> <l>c</l>.<l>name</l> <r>&equals;</r> <d>'Sparkles'</d><BR><r>&nbsp; &nbsp;AND</r> <l>d</l>.<l>codepoint_id</l> <r>=</r> <l>c</l>.<l>id</l>;
Note: say we want to join our design and codepoint tables

A codepoint has multiple designs. Sparkles has an image that shows up in Android, Apple, Facebook, etc

So we want to join on the codepoint_id on the designs table to the primary codepoint id

This is a good chunk of SQL

So what does the ORM equivelent look like?
---
<pre><code><c>&dash;&dash; SQL</c><br><r>SELECT</r> d.<r>*</r> <br>&nbsp; <r>FROM</r> unicodex_codepoint c,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;unicodex_design d<br>&nbsp;<r>WHERE</r> <l>c</l>.<l>name</l> <r>&equals;</r> <d>'Sparkles'</d><BR><r>&nbsp; &nbsp;AND</r> <l>d</l>.<l>codepoint_id</l> <r>=</r> <l>c</l>.<l>id</l>;<br><br><c>&num; ORM</c>
Design.objects.filter(<o>codepoint&#95;&#95;name&equals;</o>'Sparkles')
</code></pre>
Note: Design dot objects dot filter codepoint dunder name equals sparkles. 

I know right? so simple!
---
<pre><code><c>&dash;&dash; SQL</c><br><r>SELECT</r> d.<r>*</r> <br>&nbsp; <r>FROM</r> unicodex_codepoint c,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;unicodex_design d<br>&nbsp;<r>WHERE</r> <l>c</l>.<l>name</l> <r>&equals;</r> <d>'Sparkles'</d><BR><r>&nbsp; &nbsp;AND</r> <l>d</l>.<l>codepoint_id</l> <r>=</r> <l>c</l>.<l>id</l>;<br><br><c>&num; ORM</c>
Design.objects.filter(<o>codepoint&#95;&#95;name&equals;</o>'Sparkles')
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <c>^^</c> 
</code></pre>

Note: this doubleunderscore here is doing a lot of powerful things behind the scenes 

which I'll explain more in a moment.

$$terminal python3.6

Note:

---
<pre><code><c>&num; ORM</c>
Design.objects.filter(<o>codepoint&#95;&#95;name&equals;</o>'Sparkles')

<c>&num; field, field, field... lookup</c>

Note: what we have here is one or more fields and then a lookup, all separated by double underscores

A lookup as an operation on that field

If you remember back when we looked up the fields on a model, we know what options we have here. 
---
$$terminal python3.6
$$py from unicodex.models import Design

&lt;django.db.models.fields.related.ForeignKey: codepoint>, <br>
&lt;django.db.models.fields.files.FileField: image>)<br>
$$pyw

Note: we have four fields - a unique id, two foreign keys off to other models, and image

but name isn't there. That came from codepoint

---
$$terminal python3.6

&lt;django.db.models.fields.files.FileField: image>)<br>
$$pyw Codepoint._meta.get_fields()

Note: so if we inspect Codepoint

---
$$terminal python3.6
$$py from unicodex.models import Design
$$py Design._meta.get_fields()
(&lt;django.db.models.fields.AutoField: id>,<br> 
&lt;django.db.models.fields.related.ForeignKey: vendorversion>, <br>

&lt;django.db.models.fields.TextField: description>,<br>
&lt;django.db.models.fields.CharField: codepoint>)<br>
$$pyw

Note: WE see that codepoint has the name field
---
<pre><code><c>&num; ORM</c>
Design.objects.filter(<o>codepoint&#95;&#95;name&equals;</o>'Sparkles')<br><br><c>&num; field, field, field... lookup</c>

Note: You'll also note in our example that we end on a field.

By default the look up is an exact match on the string. So effectively, name equals sparkles 
---
<pre><code><c>&num; ORM</c>
Design.objects.filter(<o>codepoint&#95;&#95;name&equals;</o>'Sparkles')<br><br><c>&num; field, field, field... lookup</c>
<br><c>&num; ORM</c>
Design.objects.filter(<o>codepoint&#95;&#95;name&#95;&#95;exact&equals;</o>'Sparkles')

Note: so by default what we're calling is codepoint name equals

#= Aside

Note: as aside, did you know that this is how those awesome admin filters work? it's true! 
---
@^ djuser_super.png
Note: if we go back to that admin page we saw right at the start
---
@^ djuser_super_h.png
Note: 

Look at the URL

It's our filters

the admin uses field lookups in it's UI

and to some extent, you can handcode this URL to do some basic filtering, even if there isn't any filters on the right hand side panel

---
$$terminal python3.6
$$py from unicodex.models import Design

&lt;django.db.models.fields.TextField: description>,<br>
&lt;django.db.models.fields.CharField: codepoint>)<br>
$$pyw

Note: 

back to our terminal

We can also forge a path down a different series of foreign keys

See the vendorversion there? Let's see what that contains
---

$$terminal python3.6
$$pyw
---
$$terminal python3.6
$$pyw from unicodex.models import VendorVersion
---

$$terminal python3.6
$$py from unicodex.models import VendorVersion
$$pyw
---
$$terminal python3.6
$$py from unicodex.models import VendorVersion
$$pyw VendorVersion._meta.get_fields()


Note: let's refresh our terminal and inspect VendorVersion

---
$$terminal python3.6
$$py from unicodex.models import VendorVersion
$$py VendorVersion._meta.get_fields()
(&lt;ManyToOneRel: unicodex.design>,<br> 
&lt;django.db.models.fields.AutoField: id>, <br>
&lt;django.db.models.fields.CharField: name>, <br>
&lt;django.db.models.fields.related.ForeignKey: vendor>)<br>
$$pyw

Note: Okay, so a vendorversion has many designs, an ID, a name, and a Vendor FK

What about Vendor?
---
$$terminal python3.6
$$py from unicodex.models import VendorVersion
$$py VendorVersion._meta.get_fields()
(&lt;ManyToOneRel: unicodex.design>,<br> 
&lt;django.db.models.fields.AutoField: id>, <br>

&lt;django.db.models.fields.related.ForeignKey: vendor>)<br>

$$py VendorVersion._meta.get_fields()
(&lt;ManyToOneRel: unicodex.design>,<br> 
&lt;django.db.models.fields.AutoField: id>, <br>
&lt;django.db.models.fields.CharField: name>, <br>
&lt;django.db.models.fields.related.ForeignKey: vendor>)<br>
$$py from unicodex.models import Vendor

---
$$terminal python3.6
$$py from unicodex.models import VendorVersion
$$py VendorVersion._meta.get_fields()
(&lt;ManyToOneRel: unicodex.design>,<br> 
&lt;django.db.models.fields.AutoField: id>, <br>
&lt;django.db.models.fields.CharField: name>, <br>
&lt;django.db.models.fields.related.ForeignKey: vendor>)<br>
$$py from unicodex.models import Vendor
$$pyw Vendor._meta.get_fields()


Note: clear our terminal, import Vendor, and check

---
$$terminal python3.6
$$py from unicodex.models import VendorVersion
$$py VendorVersion._meta.get_fields()
(&lt;ManyToOneRel: unicodex.design>,<br> 
&lt;django.db.models.fields.AutoField: id>, <br>
&lt;django.db.models.fields.CharField: name>, <br>
&lt;django.db.models.fields.related.ForeignKey: vendor>)<br>
$$py from unicodex.models import Vendor
$$py Vendor._meta.get_fields()
(&lt;ManyToOneRel: unicodex.vendorversion>, <br>
&lt;django.db.models.fields.AutoField: id>, <br>
&lt;django.db.models.fields.CharField: name>) <br>
$$pyw

Note: so vendor has a relationship with vendorversion, an id and a name too

And thus, we have exhausted our search, and we could build up a UML diagram showing the relationships between all the tables in this app

But I woldn't do that too you. 

Back to what we were doing, showing filter walks

Note: And thus, we get a of all designs where the name of the linked vendor contains Micro

---
##= ... `AND`?
Note: 

So far we've dealt with single or chained filters, which will AND together

name equals sparkles AND image ends with png AND AND AND

If we want to start using OR, we need to get a bit fancy
---
#= `Q`

Note: This is where Q comes in

No, not the race from the great Star Trek sequel, The Next Generation, 

Q and in Query

With Q, we can build up AND, OR, and NOT statements in our where clause when filtering objects

So, let's start some comparisons...
---
<pre><code><c>&num; ORM</c>
Codepoint.objects.filter(
&nbsp; <o>name=</o>'Sparkles',
&nbsp; <o>description=</o>'Shiny!'
)


Note: instead of using our super long chaining filter, let's use a simpler example here
this query would give us codepoints named sparkles with the description shiny

---
<pre><code><c>&num; ORM</c>
Codepoint.objects.filter(
&nbsp; <o>name=</o>'Sparkles',
&nbsp; <o>description=</o>'Shiny!'
)<br><br><c>&dash;&dash; SQL</c><br><r>SELECT * 
&nbsp; FROM</r> unicodex_codepoint c <br><r>&nbsp;WHERE</r> <l>c</l>.<l>name</l> <r>=</r> <d>'Sparkles'</d><br><r>&nbsp; &nbsp;AND</r> <l>c</l>.<l>description</l> <r>=</r> <d>'Shiny!'</d>

Note: this would be the equvilent SQL
---
<pre><code><c>&num; ORM</c>
Codepoint.objects.filter(
&nbsp; <o>name&#95;&#95;exact=</o>'Sparkles',
&nbsp; <o>description&#95;&#95;exact=</o>'Shiny!'
)<br><br><c>&dash;&dash; SQL</c><br><r>SELECT * 
&nbsp; FROM</r> unicodex_codepoint c <br><r>&nbsp;WHERE</r> <l>c</l>.<l>name</l> <r>=</r> <d>'Sparkles'</d><br><r>&nbsp; &nbsp;AND</r> <l>c</l>.<l>description</l> <r>=</r> <d>'Shiny!'</d>

Note: And we learnt earlier that unless there's a field lookup defined, we assume exact

This is the same SQL

We can also express this same statement using Q
---

<pre><code><c>&num; ORM</c>
Codepoint.objects.filter(
&nbsp; <o>name=</o>'Sparkles',
&nbsp; <o>description=</o>'Shiny!'
)<br><br><c>&dash;&dash; SQL</c><br><r>SELECT * 
&nbsp; FROM</r> unicodex_codepoint c <br><r>&nbsp;WHERE</r> <l>c</l>.<l>name</l> <r>=</r> <d>'Sparkles'</d><br><r>&nbsp; &nbsp;AND</r> <l>c</l>.<l>description</l> <r>=</r> <d>'Shiny!'</d>

Note: so going back to our first example, 
---
<pre><code><c>&num; ORM</c>
Codepoint.objects.filter(
&nbsp; <o>name=</o>'Sparkles').filter(
&nbsp; <o>description=</o>'Shiny!'
)<br><br><c>&dash;&dash; SQL</c><br><r>SELECT * 
&nbsp; FROM</r> unicodex_codepoint c <br><r>&nbsp;WHERE</r> <l>c</l>.<l>name</l> <r>=</r> <d>'Sparkles'</d><br><r>&nbsp; &nbsp;AND</r> <l>c</l>.<l>description</l> <r>=</r> <d>'Shiny!'</d>

Note: we could also have two separate filter clauses. 
---
<pre><code><c>&num; ORM</c>
Codepoint.objects.filter(
&nbsp; <o>name=</o>'Sparkles',
&nbsp; <o>description=</o>'Shiny!'
)<br><br><c>&dash;&dash; SQL</c><br><r>SELECT * 
&nbsp; FROM</r> unicodex_codepoint c <br><r>&nbsp;WHERE</r> <l>c</l>.<l>name</l> <r>=</r> <d>'Sparkles'</d><br><r>&nbsp; &nbsp;AND</r> <l>c</l>.<l>description</l> <r>=</r> <d>'Shiny!'</d>

Note: we could also

---
<pre><code><c>&num; ORM</c>
Codepoint.objects.filter(
&nbsp; Q(<o>name=</o>'Sparkles'),
&nbsp; Q(<o>description=</o>'Shiny!')
)<br><br><c>&dash;&dash; SQL</c><br><r>SELECT * 
&nbsp; FROM</r> unicodex_codepoint c <br><r>&nbsp;WHERE</r> <l>c</l>.<l>name</l> <r>=</r> <d>'Sparkles'</d><br><r>&nbsp; &nbsp;AND</r> <l>c</l>.<l>description</l> <r>=</r> <d>'Shiny!'</d>

Note: wrap our two filter parameters in Q

This provides the same result

Notice in all of this, the equivelent SQL hasn't changed. 

With our comma here, we're implying we're using AND here. We can be explicit

---
<pre><code><c>&num; ORM</c>
Codepoint.objects.filter(
&nbsp; Q(<o>name=</o>'Sparkles') <r>&</r>
&nbsp; Q(<o>description=</o>'Shiny!')
)<br><br><c>&dash;&dash; SQL</c><br><r>SELECT * 
&nbsp; FROM</r> unicodex_codepoint c <br><r>&nbsp;WHERE</r> <l>c</l>.<l>name</l> <r>=</r> <d>'Sparkles'</d><br><r>&nbsp; &nbsp;AND</r> <l>c</l>.<l>description</l> <r>=</r> <d>'Shiny!'</d>

Note: 

But, since we have Q objects, we can do operations on them

Here, we're saying filter by this Query, and this Query

And we're using AND here explitictly

We don't have to wrap both in Q, either
---
<pre><code><c>&num; ORM</c>
Codepoint.objects.filter(
&nbsp; Q(<o>name=</o>'Sparkles'),</r>
&nbsp; Q(<o>description=</o>'Shiny!')
)<br><br><c>&dash;&dash; SQL</c><br><r>SELECT * 
&nbsp; FROM</r> unicodex_codepoint c <br><r>&nbsp;WHERE</r> <l>c</l>.<l>name</l> <r>=</r> <d>'Sparkles'</d><br><r>&nbsp; &nbsp;AND</r> <l>c</l>.<l>description</l> <r>=</r> <d>'Shiny!'</d>

Note: going back to our changed example
---
<pre><code><c>&num; ORM</c>
Codepoint.objects.filter(
&nbsp; Q(<o>name=</o>'Sparkles'),

Note: and we don't have to wrap either. But what if we wrap just the second
So, we could just wrap the second one, and leave the first one alone, right?


---
<pre><code><c>&num; ORM</c>
Codepoint.objects.filter(
&nbsp; <o>name=</o>'Sparkles',
&nbsp; Q(<o>description=</o>'Shiny!')
)<br><br><r>SyntaxError: positional argument follows keyword argument</r>

Note: well no, we get an error. 

The error here is insightful: Syntax Error, positioal argument follows keyword argument

The reasoning behind this is that in all the code we've been doing here, we've been giving arguments to the filter function

And in python, you have to declare positional argumnet before keyword argumnets

Remembering that even in these new Django concepts, we're still using Python, so python rules still apply. 
---

<pre><code><c>&num; ORM</c>
Codepoint.objects.filter(
&nbsp; <o>name=</o>'Sparkles',
&nbsp; <o>description=</o>'Shiny!'
)<br><br><c>&dash;&dash; SQL</c><br><r>SELECT * 
&nbsp; FROM</r> unicodex_codepoint c <br><r>&nbsp;WHERE</r> <l>c</l>.<l>name</l> <r>=</r> <d>'Sparkles'</d><br><r>&nbsp; &nbsp;AND</r> <l>c</l>.<l>description</l> <r>=</r> <d>'Shiny!'</d>

Note: Another example of this. Let's put our code back working, and try changing that description

Say we want to search for sparkles and unicorns

So we search for name equals sparkles and name equals unicorns and 
---
<pre><code><c>&num; ORM</c>
Codepoint.objects.filter(
&nbsp; <o>name=</o>'Sparkles',
&nbsp; <o>name=</o>'Unicorn'
)<br><br><r>SyntaxError: keyword argument repeated</r>

Note: oh. There's an error. 

This is agan, because Python. You can't repeat keyword aguments. But, you can get around this. 
Just wrap it in Q

---
<pre><code><c>&num; ORM</c>
Codepoint.objects.filter(
&nbsp; Q(<o>name=</o>'Sparkles'),
&nbsp; Q(<o>name=</o>'Unicorn')
)<br><br><c>&dash;&dash; SQL</c><br><r>SELECT * 
&nbsp; FROM</r> unicodex_codepoint c <br><r>&nbsp;WHERE</r> <l>c</l>.<l>name</l> <r>=</r> <d>'Sparkles'</d><br><r>&nbsp; &nbsp;AND</r> <l>c</l>.<l>name</l> <r>=</r> <d>'Unicorn'</d>

Note: now, this code is valid python, but it isn't useful, because it will never return any results. 

We're asking for exact string matches on the same column, twice. It'll always be an empty set. 

But what we can do is change this from an and, to an OR

---
<pre><code><c>&num; ORM</c>
Codepoint.objects.filter(
&nbsp; Q(<o>name=</o>'Sparkles') &
&nbsp; Q(<o>name=</o>'Unicorn')
)<br><br><c>&dash;&dash; SQL</c><br><r>SELECT * 
&nbsp; FROM</r> unicodex_codepoint c <br><r>&nbsp;WHERE</r> <l>c</l>.<l>name</l> <r>=</r> <d>'Sparkles'</d><br><r>&nbsp; &nbsp;AND</r> <l>c</l>.<l>name</l> <r>=</r> <d>'Unicorn'</d>

Note: Using the comma is equiv to this AND, but with the comma we're giving filter two arguments. Here, we're giving it one. We'll get back to this, because it's really cool

So, to take our AND to and OR, we change the ampersand

---
<pre><code><c>&num; ORM</c>
Codepoint.objects.filter(
&nbsp; Q(<o>name=</o>'Sparkles') |
&nbsp; Q(<o>name=</o>'Unicorn')
)<br><br><c>&dash;&dash; SQL</c><br><r>SELECT * 
&nbsp; FROM</r> unicodex_codepoint c <br><r>&nbsp;WHERE</r> <l>c</l>.<l>name</l> <r>=</r> <d>'Sparkles'</d><br><r>&nbsp; &nbsp; OR</r> <l>c</l>.<l>name</l> <r>=</r> <d>'Unicorn'</d>

Note: to a pipe. 

This is an or operation

You may have only seen these operators before in bitmasking

---
$$terminal python3.6
$$pyw
---
$$terminal python3.6
$$pyw x = 0b10101010

Note: if we have X as a binary string of one zero one zero

---
$$terminal python3.6
$$py  x = 0b10101010
$$pyw 

---
$$terminal python3.6
$$py  x = 0b10101010
$$pyw y = 0b11110000

Note: and we have y as one one one zero zero zero zero

we can do something called bit masking

---
$$terminal python3.6
$$py  x = 0b10101010
$$py y = 0b11110000
$$pyw 

---
$$terminal python3.6
$$py  x = 0b10101010
$$py y = 0b11110000
$$pyw bin(x & y)

Note: if we ask for x AND y

---
$$terminal python3.6
$$py  x = 0b10101010
$$py y = 0b11110000
$$py bin(x & y)
'0b10100000'<br>
$$pyw

Note: we get 10100000

For each bit, we only return 1 if both are 1

---
$$terminal python3.6
$$py  x = 0b10101010
$$py y = 0b11110000
$$py bin(x & y)
'0b10100000'<br>
$$pyw bin(x | y)

Note: conversely, if we ask for x OR y

---
$$terminal python3.6
$$py  x = 0b10101010
$$py y = 0b11110000
$$py bin(x & y)
'0b10100000'<br>
$$py bin(x | y)
'0b11110101'

Note: we get all ones at the start, then our stripes

That's because we return one is either or are 1


That's how binary ANDs and binary ORs work

This is very similar to what we do in SQL. 

For each row of a table, we want to return it in our result set if BOTH conditions are true on and, or if either are true on and OR

---
<pre><code><c>&num; ORM</c>
Codepoint.objects.filter(
&nbsp; Q(<o>name=</o>'Sparkles') |
&nbsp; Q(<o>name=</o>'Unicorn')
)<br><br><c>&dash;&dash; SQL</c><br><r>SELECT * 
&nbsp; FROM</r> unicodex_codepoint c <br><r>&nbsp;WHERE</r> <l>c</l>.<l>name</l> <r>=</r> <d>'Sparkles'</d><br><r>&nbsp; &nbsp; OR</r> <l>c</l>.<l>name</l> <r>=</r> <d>'Unicorn'</d>


Note: so, using the and or operators here makes sense, because those are the actions we are performing

But, we're doing these operations on Query objects, not binary. Do how does that work?

What's happening here is metaprogramming. Sometimes confused for magic, it's a funcitonlaity of python that makes it really powerful. 

I'm going to show you a small snippet of django source code. It won't be scary, don't worry.

vv [django db/models/utils.py](https://github.com/django/django/blame/5256a805ff1c31e4d5112627846291e91c5dc65d/django/db/models/query_utils.py#L142)

Note: django literally overloads the operations that happens when you try and do bitwise operations on the Q class in order for Q to have a logical response to bitwise operations

and it means you can do bitwise operations on Q obecjts and it's compeltely valid python

it's composble, it's functional, and it's intuative. 

and it's been in Django for over 10 years

---
<pre><code><c>&num; ORM</c>
Codepoint.objects.filter(
&nbsp; Q(<o>name=</o>'Sparkles') |
&nbsp; Q(<o>name=</o>'Unicorn')
)<br><br><c>&dash;&dash; SQL</c><br><r>SELECT * 
&nbsp; FROM</r> unicodex_codepoint c <br><r>&nbsp;WHERE</r> <l>c</l>.<l>name</l> <r>=</r> <d>'Sparkles'</d><br><r>&nbsp; &nbsp; OR</r> <l>c</l>.<l>name</l> <r>=</r> <d>'Unicorn'</d>

Note: as well as AND or OR, we can also do NOT

So with our code above

---
<pre><code><c>&num; ORM</c>
Codepoint.objects.filter(
&nbsp; Q(<o>name=</o>'Sparkles') |
&nbsp; ~Q(<o>name=</o>'Unicorn')
)<br><br><c>&dash;&dash; SQL</c><br><r>SELECT * 
&nbsp; FROM</r> unicodex_codepoint c <br><r>&nbsp;WHERE</r> <l>c</l>.<l>name</l> <r>=</r> <d>'Sparkles'</d><br><r> &nbsp; &nbsp;OR NOT</r> <l>c</l>.<l>name</l> <r>=</r> <d>'Unicorn'</d>


Note: we can and a tilda negation to invert that part of the query, and add a NOT to our SQL

Using our field lookups and these operations, we can do a lot of things. But are some limitations

Firstly, you need to understand how the joins happen in order avoid confusion

---
<pre><code><c>&num; ORM</c>
Codepoint.objects.filter(
&nbsp; <o>design&#95;&#95;image&#95;&#95;contains=</o>"png",
&nbsp; <o>design&#95;&#95;image&#95;&#95;startswith=</o>"design")

Note: Consider the following we want codepoints where their design iages have png and start with design

THis is based on the filename I'm using for the iages uploaded to my models

Okay. Let's run that and see what happens

Note: 

And we get back a reeeeeeally long queryset. 

But, the resuts are truncated for us

This is so incredibly useful

Data is still there, if you iterate over the list, but the print representation specificalyl doesn't flood your terminal

(this was implemented because of a very real bug at Lawrance Journal World, where they had servers keep crashing, because the debug page was trying to be helpful and show all the data... a million objects worth..)

Note: well, we can tell it's a different SQL statement than before based on the length of the output.. but let's format itnicely and see what's going on

<pre><code><c>&num; ORM</c>
Codepoint.objects.filter(
&nbsp; <o>design&#95;&#95;image&#95;&#95;contains=</o>"png").filter(
&nbsp; <o>design&#95;&#95;image&#95;&#95;startswith=</o>"design").count()<br><br><c>&dash;&dash; SQL</c><br><r>SELECT</r> <l>count</l>(<r>&#42;</r>)

&nbsp; &nbsp; <r>AND</r> <l>E</l>.<l>image</l> <r>LIKE</r> <d>'design%'</d>)

Note: Ah. 

We have TWO joins happening here

Every time there is a separate filter, it's another join. Which can absolutely be useful, but not when you're matching on the same associated table in both filters, as you can't join those references together. 

To do that, put them both in the same filter call. Django will be able to work it out, then.

~@ hunterbird.jpg

Note: so now that we know how to hunt let's find that bug

---

@^ unicodex_sparkles_bug.png

Note: we have a broken image somewhere. We can tell by the page that it's probably the image associated to the with the Twitter 1.0 Sparkle design. 

So let's find that. 

Option: 'shout it out'

##= `..twemoji-1.0.png🐛"`

Note: there's my bug!

Gotcha!

I really should fix that.. meh, after my talk.

##= So

Note: So, the ORM is demonstratably great and all, but what if you have something reeeeeally complex, that you can't easily represent in the ORM?
---

##= So, what if the ORM doesn't do it?


---
##= `raw`
Note: If you really really really need to, you can drop down to raw SQL CODE 
---
#= ⚠️
Note: but

but but but

You need to be careful

If you look up the docs about how to do this

---
<div class="left"><span style="font-family: Roboto">Performing raw SQL queries</span><br><br>
<rr>The raw() manager ...</rr><br/>
<br>⚠️ <rb>You should be very careful whenever you write.</rb><br>
<br>`Abc.objects.raw('SELECT * FROM myapp_abc')`<br><br>
🗒  <rr>Where did the name of the Person table come from in that example?</rr>
<br>⚠️ <rb>No checking is done on the SQL statement that is passed in to .raw().</rb>
<br>⚠️ <rb>If you are performing queries on MySQL, note that MySQL’s silent type coercion may cause unexpected results when mixing types.</rb>
<br>⚠️ <rb>While a RawQuerySet instance can be iterated over like a normal QuerySet, RawQuerySet doesn’t implement </rb><br></div>

Note: you'll see it is FULL of warnings and notes and conditions

There are specific sections in the docs about how to give raw parameterised arguments to help prevent potential SQL injection, but you should still understand how this functionality works before you try using it. 

You also break the ability for your app to be used by multiple databases. Because of the differences in SQL between databases, your postgres flavoured code probably will break if someone wants to run it on an sqlite database 

---
##= Sometimes, the sequels are better.

Note: But sometimes, SQL is better 

the whole point of the ORM is in the name: the Object Relational Mapper. It's all about mapping objects to relations

the ORM can do 80% of things, but if there's stuff that's easier to do in RAW self, instead of wrangling the ORM, do that instead.

---
##= Discover more yourself
Note: I've only touched the surface of the power of the ORM

If I've caught your interest in the power of this part of django, you can learn more yourself
---
##= Creating objects
## Field Types
## Field Relationships

Note: How to create objects, including from raw SQL

Field types - things like email fields and image fields 

And more field relations, ways that you can call both codepoint attributes on a design object, and design attributes on a codepoint
---
##= <fl>docs.djangoproject.com</fl>

Note: seriously, the docs are wonderful. Now that you know some of the general terms of this bit of software, you should be able to find more interesting ways to make the ORM work for you

#= ☝️
##= <span style="color: white">`.`</span>
Note: Oh, and just one more note before I go
If you really want to make the ORM work well for you when developing

#= ☝️
##= `echo "ipython" >> Pipfile`
Note: add ipython as a dev requirement in your Pipfile, or requirements.txt or whereever all good python package managers store their requirements.

Note: 

So that's all I had. Hopefully with these tips and tricks about how to use the ORM to interact your project, you can start finding those pesky bugs you've been tasked to find. 

It might be a new stack to you, it might be old school, but I find the utmost dorkish joy in finding that odd little thing in a technology stack that just a short time ago I had no idea about, and then being able to harness that power. 

And being able to use your skills gained from other technology sets in new fields is really fun, sometimes a bit interesting, but always great.
